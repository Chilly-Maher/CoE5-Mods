[b] What is this?[/b]

Simple lightweight mod that gives the Baalists unique sprites. 

This does make all the footsoldiers into female sprites, I decided against giving them the female tag even though I'm pretty sure it only affects seduction auras for non-commanders. 

[b] Compatibility?[/b]

Unless any of your mods fully deletes and remakes these units, there shouldn't be any incompats. Also hardsets the size to 1x1, not that I anticipate anyone wanting to make giant hierodules, but you never know.

[b] Why?[/b]

Baalists have unique stats, but no unique sprites. Tada, fixed.

I'm breaking up my personal project into several pieces so the same mod that adds a new class doesn't also change some sprites. Timeline scales with how much I'm procrastinating.
